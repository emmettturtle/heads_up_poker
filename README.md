# Heads Up Poker: Beat Emmett!


## Overview
This project is a full browser game where you are playing heads up (1v1), texas hold em' poker, against a bot to represent me. In this first itteration of the game I have built out a full user interface and game mechanics including, basic gameplay flow, rendering, hand determination/win logic, and a basic bot. In this current itteration of the game the bot is mostly making structured random decsisions. If you have experience in player poker you would know that this can actually make the game more difficult because it is harder to predict what an hand an oppenent has. This is why experienced poker players can sometimes not do well against new players. All this to say, dont underestimate the stupid Emmett bot!!


## Game Walkthrough
